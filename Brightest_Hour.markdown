Brightest Hour

BRIGHTEST HOUR
==============
*The year is two thousand, four hundred, and ninety.*

*And something isn’t right.*

Character
---------
*This is not a place you have ever been. You breath in the dust of this dingy, alien room, collecting your thoughts. And then the bullet slams into your temple.*

You. You do not know where you are, or how you got here. You will die. But death is no escape. Wherever you are, it will kill you, over and over again. You will come back, moments before your death, as many times as it takes for you to learn. Whatever is happening here, you know what it is, somewhere in the deepest recesses of your subconsciousness. Death itself will not let you rest until you understand. Until you have conquered whatever darkness keeps you breathing.

## Memories

*You remember his face. You remember his grin as he broke your fingers. You remember slitting his throat.*

Memories about the world will return to you from time to time, along with the skills you possessed prior to this rude re-awakening.

### Context

*This facility... you built it. You know the terrible reason why.*

A memory’s context unveils the world in part: you know why you woke up here, or you know what a particular phenomenon means, or anything else. As a player, the memory’s context is up to you. You get to remember the world into existence.

### Skill

This feels like something you’ve done a thousand times before. But when? Why?

As part of your memory, you recall skills you once had, whether it be the
knowledge of a machinist, burglar, soldier, or whatever else your imagination
can conjure up. Skills reflect the sort of careers you held, or the kinds of
work you performed regularly. Skills make related tasks easier, including
combat and particularly conversation. They add +1 to your attempts wherever
they apply. You can “remember” the same skill many times. Each time, your
proficiency with it improves, adding another +1 to relevant attempts.

**Using Skills**

  1. Sum 3 and any modifiers, including your skill. This is your attempt.
  2. If your attempt is higher than the task’s difficulty, you succeed.
  1. Note: If you lack a relevant skill, you suffer -2 to your attempt.

**Task Difficulty**

  1. Normal people do this regularly.
  2. Amateurs practice doing this.
  3. Typical professional activity.
  4. The pinnacle of untrained achievement.
  5. Professionals find this difficult.
  6. Advanced techniques will seem insufficient.
  7. Seemingly inhuman accomplishment.
  8. The fullest extent of human capacity.

## Combat
*Life is forced upon you once more. The bullet impacted the left side of your skull, originating from the apartment complex in that direction. The shooter won't be so lucky this time. You grab the rifle from the body beside you and dive behind some rubble as the first shot rings out. "Not this time," you think. You cock the weapon and breathe deep. "Not this time."*

Inevitably, you will try to defend yourself. Inevitably, you will fail. But there is always a way to survive.

You act in combat by taking actions. Each action costs one stamina, though some actions allow you to spend more. Unless otherwise noted, you can only act once 

### Actions

**Attack**

You squeeze the trigger, and a heart stops.

Attempt to harm a target using a readied object, whether weapon-like or
otherwise.

  2. If your roll plus modifiers is higher than the target’s avoidance, you hit.
  3. However much higher your roll was than your target’s avoidance, add that to your weapon’s damage.
  4. Subtract the result from your target’s health.
  1. Note: You can spend stamina to improve your chances. Each extra adds +1 to hit.

intact.
